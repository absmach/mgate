# mProxy

![Go Report Card][grc]
[![License][LIC-BADGE]][LIC]

mProxy is an MQTT proxy.

It is deployed in front of MQTT broker and can be used for authorization, packet inspection and modification,
logging and debugging and various other purposes.

## Usage

```bash
go get github.com/absmach/mproxy
cd $(GOPATH)/github.com/absmach/mproxy
make
./mproxy
```

## Architecture

mProxy starts TCP and WS servers, offering connections to devices. Upon the connection, it establishes a session with a remote MQTT broker.
It then pipes packets from devices to MQTT broker, inspecting or modifying them as they flow through proxy.

Here is the flow in more details:

- Device connects to mProxy's TCP server
- mProxy accepts the inbound (IN) connection and estabishes a new session with remote MQTT broker
  (i.e. it dials out to MQTT broker only once it accepted new connection from a device.
  This way one device-mProxy connection corresponds to one mProxy-MQTT broker connection.)
- mProxy then spawn 2 goroutines: one that will read incoming packets from device-mProxy socket (INBOUND or UPLINK),
  inspect them (calling event handlers) and write them to mProxy-broker socket (forwarding them towards the broker)
  and other that will be reading MQTT broker responses from mProxy-broker socket and writing them towards device,
  in device-mProxy socket (OUTBOUND or DOWNLINK).

mProxy can parse and understand MQTT packages, and upon their detection it actually calls external event handlers.
Event handlers should implement the following interface defined in [pkg/mqtt/events.go](pkg/mqtt/events.go):

```go
// Handler is an interface for mProxy hooks
type Handler interface {
    // Authorization on client `CONNECT`
    // Each of the params are passed by reference, so that it can be changed
    AuthConnect(ctx context.Context) error

    // Authorization on client `PUBLISH`
    // Topic is passed by reference, so that it can be modified
    AuthPublish(ctx context.Context, topic *string, payload *[]byte) error

    // Authorization on client `SUBSCRIBE`
    // Topics are passed by reference, so that they can be modified
    AuthSubscribe(ctx context.Context, topics *[]string) error

    // After client successfully connected
    Connect(ctx context.Context)

    // After client successfully published
    Publish(ctx context.Context, topic *string, payload *[]byte)

    // After client successfully subscribed
    Subscribe(ctx context.Context, topics *[]string)

    // After client unsubscribed
    Unsubscribe(ctx context.Context, topics *[]string)

    // Disconnect on connection with client lost
    Disconnect(ctx context.Context)
}
```

An example of implementation is given [here](examples/simple/simple.go), alongside with it's [`main()` function](cmd/main.go).

## Deployment

mProxy does not do load balancing - just pure and simple proxying with TLS termination. This is why it should be deployed
right in front of it's corresponding MQTT broker instance: one mProxy for each MQTT broker instance in the MQTT cluster.

Usually this is done by deploying mProxy as a side-car in the same Kubernetes pod alongside with MQTT broker instance (MQTT cluster node).

LB tasks can be offloaded to a standard ingress proxy - for example NginX.

## Example Setup & Testing of mProxy

### Requirements

- Golang
- Mosquitto MQTT Server
- Mosquitto Publisher and Subscriber Client

### Example Setup of mProxy

mProxy is used to proxy requests to a backend server. For the example setup, we will use Mosquitto server as the backend for MQTT, and MQTT over Websocket and an HTTP echo server for HTTP.

1. Start the Mosquitto MQTT Server with the following command. This bash script will initiate the Mosquitto MQTT server with Websocket support. The Mosquitto Server will listen for MQTT connections on port 1883 and MQTT over Websocket connections on port 8000.

   ```bash
   examples/server/mosquitto/server.sh
   ```

2. Start the HTTP Echo Server:

   ```bash
   go run examples/server/http-echo/main.go  
   ```

3. Start the OCSP Mock responder:

   ```bash
    go run examples/ocsp-responder/main.go  
   ```

4. Start the example mProxy servers for various protocols:

   ```bash
   go run cmd/main.go
   ```

   The cmd/main.go Go program initializes mProxy servers for the following protocols:

   - mProxy server for `MQTT` protocol `without TLS` on port `1884`
   - mProxy server for `MQTT` protocol `with TLS` on port `8883`
   - mProxy server for `MQTT` protocol `with mTLS` on port `8884`
   - mProxy server for `MQTT over Websocket without TLS` on port `8083`
   - mProxy server for `MQTT over Websocket with TLS` on port `8084`
   - mProxy server for `MQTT over Websocket with mTLS` on port `8085` with prefix path `/mqtt`
   - mProxy server for `HTTP protocol without TLS` on port `8086` with prefix path `/messages`
   - mProxy server for `HTTP protocol with TLS` on port `8087` with prefix path `/messages`
   - mProxy server for `HTTP protocol with mTLS` on port `8088` with prefix path `/messages`
