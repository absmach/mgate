# mProxy

![Go Report Card][grc]
[![License][LIC-BADGE]][LIC]

mProxy is an MQTT proxy.

It is deployed in front of an MQTT broker and can be used for authorization, packet inspection and modification, logging and debugging and various other purposes.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/absmach/mproxy.git
cd mproxy
make
./build/mproxy
```

## Architecture

mProxy starts TCP and WS servers, offering connections to devices. Upon the connection, it establishes a session with a remote MQTT broker. It then pipes packets from devices to the MQTT broker, inspecting or modifying them as they flow through the proxy.

Here is the flow in more detail:

- The Device connects to mProxy's TCP server
- mProxy accepts the inbound (IN) connection and establishes a new session with the remote MQTT broker (i.e. it dials out to the MQTT broker only once it accepts a new connection from a device. This way one device-mProxy connection corresponds to one mProxy-MQTT broker connection.)
- mProxy then spawns 2 goroutines: one that will read incoming packets from the device-mProxy socket (INBOUND or UPLINK), inspect them (calling event handlers) and write them to mProxy-broker socket (forwarding them towards the broker) and other that will be reading MQTT broker responses from mProxy-broker socket and writing them towards device, in device-mProxy socket (OUTBOUND or DOWNLINK).

mProxy can parse and understand MQTT packages, and upon their detection, it calls external event handlers. Event handlers should implement the following interface defined in [pkg/mqtt/events.go](pkg/mqtt/events.go):

```go
// Handler is an interface for mProxy hooks
type Handler interface {
    // Authorization on client `CONNECT`
    // Each of the params are passed by reference, so that it can be changed
    AuthConnect(ctx context.Context) error

    // Authorization on client `PUBLISH`
    // Topic is passed by reference, so that it can be modified
    AuthPublish(ctx context.Context, topic *string, payload *[]byte) error

    // Authorization on client `SUBSCRIBE`
    // Topics are passed by reference, so that they can be modified
    AuthSubscribe(ctx context.Context, topics *[]string) error

    // After client successfully connected
    Connect(ctx context.Context)

    // After client successfully published
    Publish(ctx context.Context, topic *string, payload *[]byte)

    // After client successfully subscribed
    Subscribe(ctx context.Context, topics *[]string)

    // After client unsubscribed
    Unsubscribe(ctx context.Context, topics *[]string)

    // Disconnect on connection with client lost
    Disconnect(ctx context.Context)
}
```

An example of implementation is given [here](examples/simple/simple.go), alongside with it's [`main()` function](cmd/main.go).

## Deployment

mProxy does not do load balancing - just pure and simple proxying with TLS termination. This is why it should be deployed
right in front of it's corresponding MQTT broker instance: one mProxy for each MQTT broker instance in the MQTT cluster.

Usually, this is done by deploying mProxy as a side-car in the same Kubernetes pod alongside with MQTT broker instance (MQTT cluster node).

LB tasks can be offloaded to a standard ingress proxy - for example, NginX.

## Example Setup & Testing of mProxy

### Requirements

- Golang
- Mosquitto MQTT Server
- Mosquitto Publisher and Subscriber Client

### Example Setup of mProxy

mProxy is used to proxy requests to a backend server. For the example setup, we will use Mosquitto server as the backend for MQTT, and MQTT over Websocket and an HTTP echo server for HTTP.

1. Start the Mosquitto MQTT Server with the following command. This bash script will initiate the Mosquitto MQTT server with WebSocket support. The Mosquitto Server will listen for MQTT connections on port 1883 and MQTT over WebSocket connections on port 8000.

   ```bash
   examples/server/mosquitto/server.sh
   ```

2. Start the HTTP Echo Server:

   ```bash
   go run examples/server/http-echo/main.go
   ```

3. Start the OCSP/CRL Mock responder:

   ```bash
    go run examples/ocsp-crl-responder/main.go
   ```

4. Start the example mProxy servers for various protocols:

   ```bash
   go run cmd/main.go
   ```

   The `cmd/main.go` Go program initializes mProxy servers for the following protocols:

   - mProxy server for `MQTT` protocol `without TLS` on port `1884`
   - mProxy server for `MQTT` protocol `with TLS` on port `8883`
   - mProxy server for `MQTT` protocol `with mTLS` on port `8884`
   - mProxy server for `MQTT over WebSocket without TLS` on port `8083`
   - mProxy server for `MQTT over WebSocket with TLS` on port `8084`
   - mProxy server for `MQTT over WebSocket with mTLS` on port `8085` with prefix path `/mqtt`
   - mProxy server for `HTTP protocol without TLS` on port `8086` with prefix path `/messages`
   - mProxy server for `HTTP protocol with TLS` on port `8087` with prefix path `/messages`
   - mProxy server for `HTTP protocol with mTLS` on port `8088` with prefix path `/messages`

## mProxy Configuration Environment Variables

### Server Configuration Environment Variables

- `ADDRESS` : Specifies the address at which mProxy will listen. Supports MQTT, MQTT over WebSocket, and HTTP proxy connections.
- `PATH_PREFIX` : Defines the path prefix when listening for MQTT over WebSocket or HTTP connections.
- `TARGET` : Specifies the address of the target server, including any prefix path if available. The target server can be an MQTT server, MQTT over WebSocket, or an HTTP server.

### TLS Configuration Environment Variables

- `CERT_FILE` : Path to the TLS certificate file.
- `KEY_FILE` : Path to the TLS certificate key file.
- `SERVER_CA_FILE` : Path to the Server CA certificate file.
- `CLIENT_CA_FILE` : Path to the Client CA certificate file.
- `CERT_VERIFICATION_METHODS` : Methods for validating certificates. Accepted values are `ocsp` or `crl`.
  For the `ocsp` value, the `tls.Config` attempts to retrieve the OCSP responder/server URL from the Authority Information Access (AIA) section of the client certificate. If the client certificate lacks an OCSP responder URL or if an alternative URL is preferred, you can override it using the environmental variable `OCSP_RESPONDER_URL`.  
  For the `crl` value, the `tls.Config` attempts to obtain the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) file from the CRL Distribution Point section in the client certificate. If the client certificate lacks a CRL distribution point section, or if you prefer to override it, you can use the environmental variables `CRL_DISTRIBUTION_POINTS` and `CRL_DISTRIBUTION_POINTS_ISSUER_CERT_FILE`. If no CRL distribution point server is available, you can specify an offline CRL file using the environmental variables `OFFLINE_CRL_FILE` and `OFFLINE_CRL_ISSUER_CERT_FILE`.

#### OCSP Configuration Environment Variables

- `OCSP_DEPTH` : Depth of client certificate verification in the OCSP method. The default value is 0, meaning there is no limit, and all certificates are verified.
- `OCSP_RESPONDER_URL` : Override value for the OCSP responder URL present in the Authority Information Access (AIA) section of the client certificate. If left empty, it expects the OCSP responder URL from the AIA section of the client certificate.

#### CRL Configuration Environment Variables

- `CRL_DEPTH`: Depth of client certificate verification in the CRL method. The default value is 1, meaning only the leaf certificate is verified.
- `CRL_DISTRIBUTION_POINTS` : Override for the CRL Distribution Point value present in the certificate's CRL Distribution Point section.
- `CRL_DISTRIBUTION_POINTS_ISSUER_CERT_FILE` : Path to the issuer certificate file for verifying the CRL retrieved from `CRL_DISTRIBUTION_POINTS`.
- `OFFLINE_CRL_FILE` : Path to the offline CRL file, which can be used if the CRL Distribution point is not available in either the environmental variable or the certificate's CRL Distribution Point section.
- `OFFLINE_CRL_ISSUER_CERT_FILE` : Location of the issuer certificate file for verifying the offline CRL file specified in `OFFLINE_CRL_FILE`.

## Adding Prefix to Environmental Variables

mProxy relies on the [caarlos0/env](https://github.com/caarlos0/env) package to load environmental variables into its [configuration](https://github.com/arvindh123/mproxy/blob/main/config.go#L15).
You can control how these variables are loaded by passing `env.Options` to the `config.EnvParse` function.

To add a prefix to environmental variables, use `env.Options{Prefix: "MPROXY_"}` from the [caarlos0/env](https://github.com/caarlos0/env) package. For example:

```go
package main
import (
  "github.com/caarlos0/env/v11"
  "github.com/absmach/mproxy"
)

mqttConfig := mproxy.Config{}
if err := mqttConfig.EnvParse(env.Options{Prefix:  "MPROXY_" }); err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
fmt.Printf("%+v\n")
```

In the above snippet, `mqttConfig.EnvParse` expects all environmental variables with the prefix `MPROXY_`.
For instance:

- MPROXY_ADDRESS
- MPROXY_PATH_PREFIX
- MPROXY_TARGET
- MPROXY_CERT_FILE
- MPROXY_KEY_FILE
- MPROXY_SERVER_CA_FILE
- MPROXY_CLIENT_CA_FILE
- MPROXY_CERT_VERIFICATION_METHODS
- MPROXY_OCSP_DEPTH
- MPROXY_OCSP_RESPONDER_URL
- MPROXY_CRL_DEPTH
- MPROXY_CRL_DISTRIBUTION_POINTS
- MPROXY_CRL_DISTRIBUTION_POINTS_ISSUER_CERT_FILE
- MPROXY_OFFLINE_CRL_FILE
- MPROXY_OFFLINE_CRL_ISSUER_CERT_FILE
